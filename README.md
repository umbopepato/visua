## Documentation

See [visua.io](https://visua.io/) for guidance and the full documentation.

## Identity files

Visua is built around the concept of **identity files**: CSS files used as a "config" to store all the characteristics
of a brand identity in the form of CSS variables. Something like this:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #276FFF;
    --secondary-color: #00DBFF;
    --font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
    --headings-font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
    --spacer: 1.2em;
}
```

The package itself consists of a set of tools to work with this type of files, from parsing them to running code
generation tasks.

## Install

If you want to use visua API in your node project, install it as a normal dependency:

```bash
$ npm i visua
```

and use it in your module:

```typescript
import {visua, StyleMap} from 'visua';

const styleMap: StyleMap = visua({
    path: 'identity/',
});
```

If you plan to use it to only run code generation plugins, consider installing it as a devDependency:

```bash
$ npm i -D visua
```

## Running plugins

Plugins are small tasks run by the CLI to perform operations on the parsed identity files such as generating themes
and assets. [`visua-bootstrap`](https://github.com/umbopepato/visua-bootstrap) is a basic plugin that maps a set of
common variables to bootstrap scss variables and creates for you a `variables.scss` file that you can later use to build
your [themed bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming).

Install it by running:

```bash
$ npm i -D visua-bootstrap

# Visua plugins are npm packages whose names start with visua-
```

Create an identity file named `identity.css` in the project folder and run the plugin:

```bash
$ npx visua run bootstrap
```
